    <h2>Homestay with a difference</h2>
    <p> Even as villages offering home-stays become increasingly common in the Himalaya, there are some that are
        different. Sarmoli, located on the slopes above Munsiari town in Uttarakhand, offers an experience that few
        others can.

        Sitting on the balcony of a house with a breathtaking view of the valley below and a line of snowpeaks on the
        horizon, we could see why Sarmoli is an ideal location for sensitive tourism. Till the mid-1990s, visitors would
        stay at Munsiari town or move on, providing little to the local rural economy. When Malika Virdi and E.
        Theophilus (a couple who came to do environmental and livelihood work) made Sarmoli their home in 1992, Malika
        realised the potential of running a nature-based and community-owned tourism enterprise in the valley. In 2003,
        on being elected sarpanch of the Van Panchayat (village forest commons), Malika helped build the capacity of
        several rural women to start such facilities, linking forest conservation work to tourism as a sustainable
        livelihood option. Many women converted an existing room into a guest room with some internal redesign. If,
        however, this was not available, Malika helped them get loans to build an extension. Today the village offers 15
        homestays, and about 25 households are involved in tourism activities.

        Uniquely, the tourism-conservation-livelihood initiative offers great opportunities to visitors to participate,
        learn and contribute. Homestays involve activities for tourists relating to the agricultural cycle and the
        forest-river dynamics. Visitors have an option to become part of the village life: sowing potatoes in April and
        rajma in June, harvesting barley, wheat and mustard in summer, then planting out the same in autumn, and cutting
        and stacking grass as fodder for winter through October-November. They become part of the process of growing
        food with inputs that are locally available: free abundant sunshine, farmyard manure and farmers’ seeds and
        labour. They also learn to use solar energy to cook and even bake, to weave with wool, or to make bamboo
        artefacts for everyday use. They can collect the raw material from the surrounding forests and high-altitude
        pastures. And, of course, they can partake of the delicious local cuisine!


        As news of the opportunities spread, visitors are coming from far and wide. Each year, the village hosts around
        250 guests; so far it has had visitors from 18 countries. Young women and men from the community have become
        proficient at leading treks or explaining about local economy, culture, food, and wildlife. For nature lovers
        and trekkers, the village is a great take-off point to some of the largest ‘wilderness’ areas left in the
        Himalaya, extending well into the western ranges of Uttarakhand on one side and Nepal on the other. K.
        Ramnarayan or Ram, part of the original team with Malika and Theo and now with Himal Prakriti, has also made
        Sarmoli his home, and helps organise multi-day treks to popular destinations like Milam, Nanda Devi east base
        camp and many lesser-known destinations.</p>
    <p> Elevation: 3500 Mt.
        Approach: 6 km and 2.30 Hrs (approx) Trek from road head ( Balati Farm).
        Distance: 650 Kms from Delhi and 260 kms from Kathgodam Railway station.

        Khaliya top is a pleasant weekend trek that not many people have ventured or even heard off. The special views
        from Khaliya top of the Panchachuli and Nanda devi range is the heaven for trekkers. Which provide grand view
        and elevation of the Himalayas in very short time. Khaliya Bugyal is an alpine meadow located in Munsyari,
        Distict Pithoragarh Uttarakhand. Thus It is a day trek But further trek entails starting from 7000 feet and
        walking through typical Himalayan temperate forests to emerge onto high open alpine meadows above 12000 feet.

        Khaliya is a paradise for Trekkers, A happy hunting ground for photo shooters and encyclopaedia for bird
        watchers. A 360° view all around and open valley either side provide opportunity for paragliding and aero
        sports. The nearby slopes provide hard snow for skiing in winter and shining flower bed in spring. In all
        Khaliya is a wonderful gift of nature in the lap of kumaoun himalayas. Not only for matured trekkers, khuliya is
        easy a access for beginners and teenagers too. A keen eye can find out hidden treasures of nature in the form of
        Monal, Ghurar, Kakar, yellow fronted marten and Baral (mountain goat).

        The woods had a luxuriant mix of Pine, Deodar, Oaks, Spruce and Cypress, but the main vegetation we came across
        as we gained height were the Rhododendron trees or Buransh as it is called in the local language. In spring the
        whole jungle turns red with the rhododendron flowers. With the gain in altitude these trees change’s shape to
        bush and colour to white.

        Following Khuliya trail leading to Rantham top at an altitude of over 4000 meters going via Hiramani Glacier and
        Namik Village. The prospect of a trekking trail ahead of Khaliya Top means a week long trek which takes out to
        another valley.

        Once who got opportunity to visit this place can only experience the vastness and eco-diversity of this place.
